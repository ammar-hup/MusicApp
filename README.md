# About

This project aims to develop a robust backend infrastructure for a music platform using Django. The core components will include models for artists, albums, and songs, along with associated forms, templates, and views. The project will also incorporate Django REST Framework (DRF) for API endpoints, authentication and authorization mechanisms, and testing using pytest. Asynchronous task processing will be implemented using Celery.
